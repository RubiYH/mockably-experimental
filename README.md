# Mockably (experimental)

## 🚀 Realtime Backend Implementation on Frontend

Mockably is a frontend-first backend implementation that allows you to build realtime applications without caring about the backend server at all.

### Features I'm working on

- ✅ SQL-like CRUD operations
- ✅ Offline support (tailored for demo apps)
- ⌛️ Realtime P2P(Peer-To-Peer) data syncing
- and so on... maybe...?

### Disclaimer

I started this project without relying too much on AI, but eventually it has become my first "vibe-coded" project. It saved me a lot of time... but also it messed up my codebases. Keep in mind that this is just an experimental project..
